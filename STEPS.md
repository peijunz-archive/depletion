Define the circle/line segment class and the Connected Curve consists of segments
Define Rotation and Shift of Curves
Judge if two segments intersect and Judge if two curves intersect
Function to Calculate the area of a curve(use cross)
# Calculate the r-extention verge of a curve
## No self cut
## Primary r-extention verge
# Calculate the verge of intersection of two region
# Improve support for concave circle
初始化线段时候根据r性质进行相关判断即可。这一步必须在曲线可内凹之前完成
